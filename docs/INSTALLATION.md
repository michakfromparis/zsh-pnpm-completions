# Installation Guide

## Requirements

* **zsh** - Z-shell
* **pnpm** - pnpm package manager  
* **jq** - For parsing npm registry responses (usually pre-installed)

## üöÄ **Quick Installation (Recommended)**

### One-Line Installation

Copy and paste this single command to install automatically:

```bash
# Using curl (recommended)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michakfromparis/zsh-pnpm-completions/main/setup.sh)
```

That's it! The script will:
- ‚úÖ Detect your zsh plugin manager automatically
- ‚úÖ Install using the best available method  
- ‚úÖ Configure your `.zshrc` automatically
- ‚úÖ Create backups before making changes
- ‚úÖ Work without sudo privileges
- ‚úÖ Fall back gracefully if needed

> **Note:** If the one-liner fails (repository not yet public), use the local installation method below.
