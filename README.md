## ‚ö° **Why This Helps**

**üìù Script Completion** - Type `pnpm run <TAB>` and instantly see all your package.json scripts. No more `cat package.json | grep scripts`.

**üîç Live npm Search** - Type `pnpm add reac<TAB>` and get real packages from npmjs.com including `react`, `react-dom`, and related packages.

**üéØ Context-Aware** - Knows the difference between `pnpm add` (suggests new packages) and `pnpm remove` (suggests installed packages)

**üì¶ Optional 30+ Aliases** - Every command has a short alias: `p` = `pnpm`, `pa` = `pnpm add`, `pi` = `pnpm install`, etc. (can be disabled during installation)

## üé¨ **See It In Action**

**Script completion is the killer feature** - no more hunting through package.json files:

*The old way vs. the new way - TAB completion transforms your workflow!*

## üöÄ **Quick Installation**

### Option 1: npx (Recommended)

Install globally using npx:

```bash
npx zsh-pnpm-completions
```

This will automatically download and run the installer.

### Option 2: Direct Script

Copy and paste this single command to install automatically:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michakfromparis/zsh-pnpm-completions/main/setup.sh)
```

That's it! The script will detect your zsh plugin manager and configure everything automatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation Options**

### Install Without Aliases

If you prefer not to load the pnpm aliases (30+ shortcuts like `p` for `pnpm`, `pa` for `pnpm add`, etc.), you can install without them:

```bash
# Using npx
npx zsh-pnpm-completions --no-aliases

# Using direct script
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michakfromparis/zsh-pnpm-completions/main/setup.sh) --no-aliases
```

This sets the `ZSH_PNPM_NO_ALIASES` environment variable, which prevents the plugin from loading the alias definitions. You can always re-enable aliases later by removing this variable from your shell configuration.

**Note:** This only affects the loading of aliases - all completion functionality remains intact.

## üéØ **What You Get**

* **Script completion** from your `package.json` - the killer feature
* **Live package search** from npm registry as you type
* **Smart fallback** to 50+ popular packages (React, Vue, TypeScript, Express, etc.)
* **Workspace-aware** completions via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
* **All pnpm commands** including `dlx`, `patch`, `store`, `env`
* **Optional lightning-fast aliases** for every command (30+ shortcuts like `p` for `pnpm`)

## üóëÔ∏è **Uninstall**

To remove the plugin from your system:

```bash
# Via npx
npx zsh-pnpm-completions --uninstall

# Or via direct script
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michakfromparis/zsh-pnpm-completions/main/setup.sh) --uninstall
```

The uninstaller will:
- Remove plugin files from your system
- Clean up configuration from `~/.zshrc`
- Remove any auto-generated configurations

After uninstalling, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to fully deactivate the plugin.

## Acknowledgments

This plugin is inspired by and based on:
- [zsh-yarn-completions](https://github.com/chrisands/zsh-yarn-completions) by chrisands - The original yarn completions that served as the foundation for this plugin
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - The fast, disk space efficient package manager this plugin supports

The structure and many of the completion functions are adapted from the yarn completions project, modified to work with pnpm's command structure and features, enhanced with live npm registry search and intelligent package discovery.
